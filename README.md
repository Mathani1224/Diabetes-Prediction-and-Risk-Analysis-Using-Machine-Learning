The Diabetes Prediction and Risk Analysis Using Machine Learning project aims to predict diabetes risk based on medical and lifestyle factors such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and age. The dataset is preprocessed, and features are analyzed to build a machine learning model for accurate classification. Using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest, the model helps in early detection and preventive healthcare. This project provides data-driven insights to assist medical professionals and individuals in managing diabetes risk effectively.
